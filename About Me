	<p>I am a senior statistics student at The Ohio State University graduating in May of 2021. I recently accepted an opportunity with <a href="https://www.8451.com/">84.51°</a> to join the company's Data Scientist Development Program as a Statistical Learning Specialist. </p>
	<p>My coursework at Ohio State includes classes in statistics (33 hours, courses include: Bayesian Analysis and Statistical Decision Making, Computational Statistics, Time Series Modeling and Analysis),  mathematics (19 hours, courses include: Linear Algebra, Quanitative Neuroscience), business (15 hours, courses include: Sports Analytics, Applied Prescriptive Analytics), computer science (11 hours, courses include: Software One and Two), and German (15 hours, courses include: German Three, Representation and Memory of the Holocaust in Film). </p>
	<p>In addition to my coursework, I have had the opportunity to expand my education outside of Columbus. I studied abroad in Budapest, Hungary, in May of last summer, learning about the complex history and culture of Central Europe. I also had the opportunity to travel to London in my freshman year as a part of Ohio State's Honor's London program.</p> 
	<p>I have work experience with <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMorgan Chase and Co.</a>, the second-largest bank in the world and the global leader in financial services, <a href="https://www.elevenwarriors.com/">Eleven Warriors</a>, a Columbus-based sports website that focuses on Ohio State athletics, and <a href="https://www.matcotools.com/">Matco Tools</a>, a leading tool distribution company and subsidiary of Fortive Corporation.</p>  
	<p>To go with my professional work experience, I have worked on a number of personal projects. In my most recent project, I created a <a href="https://ohio-state-statistics.shinyapps.io/Ohio-State-Stats/">web application</a> to easily visualize some of the best individual seasons by an Ohio State player in its history. Season statistics are available for nearly 1,500 Buckeyes, with more data and features on the way.</p>
	<p>Another major personal project includes my extensive work with Spotify's API. I have used natural language processing to analyze The Weeknd's discography, analyzing song-to-song and album-to-album themes. Additionally, I have used the API to investigate my own listening habits as well as use unsupervised machine learning to find the number of song clusters present in my playlist. Other personal projects include work with the NFL's player tracking data, determining which collegiate program develops the best NFL players at the wide receiver position with advanced analytics, and simulating basketball games. </p>
	<p>While I have a number of personal projects I am working on, I have also attempted more formal approaches to enhance my technical ability. With a free trial in DataCamp, I was able to complete the "Data Scientist in R" career track, which covers topics from data manipulation and cleaning to supervised and unsupervised learning. Additionally, I have taken a number of DataCamp's assessments, scoring in the 93rd percentile in "Machine Learning Fundamentals in R", the 85th percentile in "R Programming", the 84th percentile in "Cleaning and Importing Data in R", and the 83rd percentile in "Data Manipulation in R". I have also taken two <a href = 'https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/94427/linkedin-skill-assessments?lang=en'>LinkedIn assessments</a>, passing the tests for Programming in R and Machine Learning. </p>
